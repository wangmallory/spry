# spry

The Spry dashboard will live here and allow users with access to run the dash on their local.

Alright, CS Dashboard users! To get the dashboard to your local, please follow these steps:

1. In your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/wangmallory/spry`
2. After you've cloned the repo: `cd spry`
3. Once you're in the spry directory: `sh run_CSshiny.sh`
This should cause your terminal to run a bunch of stuff but at the end you will see something like:
`Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5830`
Copy and paste `http://127.0.0.1:5830` into a browser and voila!

If I ever email you that you need to update your local, please do the following in your terminal:
1. Update your local repo: 'git pull'
2. Run your shell as you've done before `sh run_CSshiny.sh` -- make sure that you're in the repo first `cd spry`

If you have any questions, please reach out to me, Mallory via email or Slack! Happy dashboarding!
